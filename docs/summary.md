Pumped-fn was born with only one goal. Make good code easy.

That, however, lead to a rather complex debates of what is good code.
We designed the library with this definition in mind. Hopefully it fits yours

- Good code should be testable
- Good code should be fast, easy to rationale
- Good code is not the same as abstracting everything to have a good looking piece of code
